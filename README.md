This is a pet project to create a Dungons and Dragons Dungon Master program where the map is based on Ypsilanti, MI in 1875. I would like to add more cities in the future.

# Required packages

* Sqlite3

# Compile

## Program

To compile, run ```make```.

## Tests

# First Run

Be sure to run ```setup.bash``` to generate the sqlite databases for gameplay. This script can be used to recreate a default database if required.
